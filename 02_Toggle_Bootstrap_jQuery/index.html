            <h4>Course Outcomes</h4>
            <p> 
              1. To summarize capabilities and impact of software development process models and justify process 
              maturity through application of Software Engineering principles and practices,
              2. To differentiate feasible and competing system requirements, indicating correct real world 
              problem scope and preparing stepwise system conceptual model,
              3. To formulate system specifications by analyzing user-level tasks and compose software artifacts 
              using agile principles, practices and scrum framework,
              4. To compose system analysis and design specifications using UML diagrams,
              5. To design a system architecture and map it with a suitable architectural style,
              6. To comprehend the nature of design patterns and apply these patterns in system design.

              <h4>Course Relevance</h4>
              <p> 
                  Given that Software Engineering is built upon the foundations of Computer Science as well as 
                  Computer Engineering, a Software Engineering curriculum can be focused on two perspectives - a 
                  Computer Science-first or Software Engineering-first perspective. Software engineering spans the 
                  entire software lifecycle. It involves creating high-quality and reliable programs in a systematic, 
                  controlled, and efficient manner using formal methods for specification, analysis, design and 
                  evaluation of proposed systems. It requires suitable software development techniques and processes 
                  that successfully scale to large applications, which should satisfy timing, size, and security 
                  requirements all within acceptable application/project budgets and deadlines. For these reasons, 
                  Software Engineering requires both the analytical and descriptive tools and techniques developed in 
                  Computer Science and the rigor that the Computer Engineering discipline brings to the reliability and 
                  trustworthiness of the systems that software developers design and implement, while working as a 
                  cohesive team.

            <h3>Design and Analysis of Algorithm</h3>
            <h4>Course Outcomes</h4>
            <p> 
              1. Students will gain understanding of asymptotic notations and will be able to apply suitable 
              mathematical techniques to find asymptotic time and space complexities of algorithms.
              2. Students will develop the ability to formulate computational problems in the abstract and 
              mathematically precise manner.
              3. Student will gain understanding of different algorithm design paradigms such as divide and 
              conquer, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking and will apply suitable paradigm for 
              designing algorithms for computational problems.
              4. Students will develop understanding of notions of NP-hardness and NP-completeness and their 
              relationship with the intractability of decision problems.
              5. Students will design randomized, approximation algorithms for some computational problems.
              6. Students will be able to incorporate algorithm design principles, data structures and provide 
              efficient solutions for complex computational problems.

              <h4>Course Relevance</h4>
              <p> 
                  This is a foundational course for Computer science and Engineering. This course develops 
                  algorithmic thinking capability of students. Designing algorithms using suitable paradigm and 
                  analysing the algorithms for computational problems has a high relevance in all domains where 
                  computer science plays a crucial role (equally in Industry as well as research). This course is also an 
                  essential pre-requisite for advanced domain specific algorithmic courses such as Algorithmic Graph 
                  Theory, Algorithmic Number Theory, Computational Geometry, Motion planning and Robotics, etc, 
                  to give a few examples. Once the student gains expertise in Algorithm design and in general gains 
                  ability of Algorithmic thinking, it facilitates in systematic study of any other domain (in computer 
                  science or otherwise) which demands logical thinking. This course is also relevant for students who 
                  want to pursue research career in theory of computing, computational complexity theory, advanced 
                  algorithmic research.
